h1. Getting the Gist of Markdown's Formatting Syntax

This page offers a brief overview of what it's like to use Markdown.
The http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax (syntax page) provides complete, detailed documentation for
every feature, but Markdown should be very easy to pick up simply by
looking at a few examples of it in action. The examples on this page
are written in a before/after style, showing example syntax and the
HTML output produced by Markdown.

It's also helpful to simply try Markdown out; the http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus (Dingus) is a
web application that allows you type your own Markdown-formatted text
and translate it to XHTML.

h2. Paragraphs, Headers, Blockquotes

A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated
by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a
blank line -- a line containing nothing spaces or tabs is considered
blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be intended with spaces or tabs.

Markdown offers two styles of headers: *Setext* and *atx*.
Setext-style headers for <h1> and <h2> are created by
"underlining" with equal signs (=) and hyphens (-), respectively.
To create an atx-style header, you put 1-6 hash marks (#) at the
beginning of the line -- the number of hashes equals the resulting
HTML header level.

Blockquotes are indicated using email-style '>' angle brackets.

h3. Phrase Emphasis

Markdown uses asterisks and underscores to indicate spans of emphasis.
